Key Python Concepts in Action:

Lists: Storing words for the game's vocabulary
Variables: Keeping track of the chosen word, player guesses, and game state
Loops: Repeating actions like prompting for guesses and checking results
Conditional Statements: Handling logic like revealing letters, drawing hangman parts, and determining wins/losses
String Manipulation: Modifying displayed dashes and revealing letters
User Input: Using the input() function to get player guesses
Output: Using the print() function to display game information
